# wp_mass_core_switcher
Shell Script that will recursively search and detect all the WordPress installations on the server, then check version of each, download cores from WP Repo and swtich core folders and files with the fresh once. Pretty useful when server gets hacked and you need a quick way to refresh WordPress cores on each site and make sure at least those folders are malware-free
